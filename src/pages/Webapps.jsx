                At DGBITS, our in-house team of experienced web developers
                produce web applications that have helped organisations deliver
                their products and services or streamline their organisationsâ€™
                processes, helping them save money and grow. We build
                business-critical, web-facing applications, or we will stitch
                business systems together that drive efficiency and make
                business or non-profits more agile. Web applications can be as
                simple as a bespoke hook-up to an external data source, like a
                content feed, or it can be a fully mobile Progressive Web App
                (PWA) that looks and behaves like a native mobile app.

                    What Is A Web Application?
                  </Typography>
                  <Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary">
                    A Web App is a type of application software that is hosted
                    and operated on a third-party server. To access a Web App,
                    customer just needs Web browser.

                    Web Application vs Website?
                  </Typography>

                  <Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary">
                    A web application lets a user manipulate data: they can
                    create, read, update and delete information. A website,
                    however, only lets them download (read, view, listen) data
                    where a user can only access information. Hence a web app is
                    interactive, whereas a website is mostly informational.
                    Other differences: Web apps are more often integrated with
                    other software systems (e.g. CRM, ERP) integrated than
                    websites. Also, unlike websites, web apps usually require
                    authentication.
