                  <Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary">
                    Designing with a mobile-first approach makes the most of
                    what a mobile device has to offer by going against the
                    traditional direction of web design.

                  <Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary">
                    Before mobile became the dominant way folks interacted with
                    the internet, designers generally worked large to small;
                    desktop to tablet to smartphone. Hardly surprising, given
                    that the desktop long preceded the mobile phone and the
                    iPhone didnâ€™t debut until 2007.

                  <Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary">
                    Nowadays, given the current ubiquity of smartphones,
                    designers generally work small to large; starting from the
                    pocket-sized screen and scaling up from there.

                  <Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary">
                    This approach forces designers to work with the most limited
                    real estate first, on the screen size users will likely use
                    most. Instead of paring down a desktop design to fit a
                    mobile device, mobile-first designs are optimized for mobile
                    devices and then expanded for desktop.
