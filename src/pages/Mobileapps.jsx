                Hybrid app development is the development of one single
                application on one codebase, that can run on multiple operating
                systems. Typical Hybrid Apps run across Windows, iOS and Android
                devices. The most interesting thing about the hybrid App
                development is the time and cost efficiency generated by using a
                single codebase. About 80 % of the codebase can be reused for
                other operating systems, while the other 20 % are usually
                specific to each operating system.

                Notwithstanding that Hybrid Apps are developed on web
                technologies, they can provide similar UI/UX as native apps, and
                moreover have equal capabilities to work across several
                platforms. They allow developers to write only one code base
                that can be applied to all operating systems, which is very
                cost-effective.

                    As you can see from the name, hybrid apps are a mix of two
                    different applications - native apps and web apps. As a
                    rule, technologies such as CSS, HTML or JavaScript are used.
                    These can be combined with open source components of
                    frameworks like React Native or Flutter can be integrated
                    into a native application. These technologies allow hybrid
                    apps to run through each of the platformsâ€˜ implemented
                    browser, which offers the possibility to be installed on
                    mobile apps and therefore implemented into the Play Store or
                    AppStore.
